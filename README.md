Project Overview: Mango Quality Assessment

As part of an internship and mini project, we developed a system for the quality assessment of mangoes, focusing on texture, ripening, and healthiness. The project employed a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to analyze and classify the quality of mangoes effectively.

Key Contributions:

Algorithm Implementation: Leveraged Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and CNN to accurately assess the quality of mangoes based on various parameters.

Data Analysis: Processed and analyzed data related to mango texture, ripeness, and overall healthiness.

Performance Evaluation: Compared the performance of different algorithms to determine the most effective approach for quality assessment.

This project aimed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fruit quality assessment, providing a valuable tool for the agricultural industry.
